00:00:00.000	00:00:06.320	 So there are things in life that are normal and there are things in life that are not normal like today's weather
00:00:06.480	00:00:12.419	 The weather today is not normal. It is November 25th and it is 10 degrees Celsius out here
00:00:12.580	00:00:16.679	 In fact if I was to choose an English word to describe this weather
00:00:16.679	00:00:21.559	 I would choose the word bizarre the weather is bizarre for this time of year
00:00:22.000	00:00:25.120	 Normally it's minus one and maybe snowing a little bit
00:00:25.120	00:00:31.620	 But definitely this weather is bizarre when you use the word bizarre to describe something that's not normal
00:00:31.620	00:00:34.920	 You're really emphasizing that it's really not normal
00:00:35.240	00:00:37.719	 So anyways welcome to this English lesson
00:00:37.719	00:00:42.280	 Let's go a few places and let's look at a few more things that are not normal
00:00:42.280	00:00:45.799	 And I'll teach you some words and phrases you can use to describe them
00:00:46.439	00:00:53.340	 So sometimes in English we simply use the word odd to describe something that isn't how it normally is now
00:00:53.340	00:00:57.260	 It's pretty normal to have Christmas displays set up in town
00:00:57.700	00:01:03.800	 But what I find odd about this Christmas display is how early it was set up
00:01:04.460	00:01:09.379	 For me, I think that Christmas displays should be set up around December 1st
00:01:09.379	00:01:16.900	 I don't feel like they should be here at the beginning of November to me the timing is a little bit odd
00:01:17.140	00:01:21.980	 For me a normal time to set up a Christmas display would be December 1st
00:01:22.020	00:01:27.880	 That sounds like a good time Christmas is December 25th. Let's wait until December 1st
00:01:27.880	00:01:31.480	 So maybe it's just me maybe everyone else in the world loves it
00:01:31.480	00:01:38.879	 But for me setting up Christmas displays before December 1st seems a little odd a little bit not normal
00:01:39.620	00:01:42.420	 Sometimes in English we just use the word unusual
00:01:44.460	00:01:49.939	 It's unusual to see people eating ice cream cones in November in Ontario, Canada
00:01:50.659	00:01:54.980	 Normally we eat ice cream in the warmer months in June, July, August and
00:01:57.259	00:02:00.780	 Even in September, but I thought I would get an ice cream cone today
00:02:00.780	00:02:05.500	 Even though this is kind of unusual for this time of year. So again
00:02:06.019	00:02:10.699	 When you're talking about something that's not normal in English you can use the word unusual
00:02:11.060	00:02:16.060	 So sometimes in English we put the word odd and the word unusual together
00:02:16.060	00:02:19.500	 And we say that something is odd and unusual
00:02:19.979	00:02:24.539	 These houses behind me are a little bit odd and unusual in
00:02:25.340	00:02:31.460	 Ontario, Canada we don't often paint our houses with vibrant colors like this
00:02:31.460	00:02:35.780	 These are really really cool and by the way if you wanted to buy one
00:02:35.780	00:02:37.780	 I think this one is for sale
00:02:37.900	00:02:42.979	 So sometimes we say something is odd and unusual we put the two words together
00:02:43.620	00:02:45.419	 I'm gonna show you a few more of these
00:02:45.419	00:02:49.859	 I think what I like the most about these odd and unusual houses is
00:02:50.780	00:02:55.379	 How the colors are very very vibrant? I think I mentioned that already
00:02:55.979	00:02:58.139	 Even the fence in front of this house
00:02:58.779	00:03:06.219	 The house itself is a cool green this one behind me is yellow and purple mixed together
00:03:06.459	00:03:11.899	 So just very very cool kind of odd and unusual and it doesn't have to be a negative thing
00:03:11.900	00:03:18.580	 Some people really like odd and unusual things I think sometimes my English lessons are a little bit odd and unusual
00:03:18.580	00:03:20.020	 But you guys seem to like them
00:03:20.020	00:03:25.659	 So sometimes we put those two words together to describe something and say it's odd and unusual
00:03:26.460	00:03:29.580	 Sometimes you see something and you just think that's weird
00:03:29.780	00:03:35.740	 It's not what you expect to see you're like, oh, that's weird. That's a little bit weird
00:03:35.740	00:03:40.620	 I'm going to show you something that I think is a little bit weird if you look over here
00:03:40.900	00:03:45.340	 There is a spot where you can charge an electric vehicle
00:03:45.740	00:03:55.340	 But what's kind of weird is it's in an alley so you can I'm not even sure how you would get your car into this little spot and then if you look over here
00:03:56.620	00:04:03.580	 I don't even see a place where you can plug in your electric vehicle like normally there would be some sort of
00:04:03.780	00:04:09.659	 Charging station so whenever I see this whenever I'm in this town and I walk by this area
00:04:09.659	00:04:14.060	 And I see this electric car charging area. I think that's weird
00:04:14.740	00:04:21.860	 So I came to the town of Grimsby, Ontario today to make this English lesson and there's a lot more traffic than I expected
00:04:21.860	00:04:23.860	 I think this is a bit out of the ordinary
00:04:23.860	00:04:26.779	 It's one o'clock in the afternoon on a Monday
00:04:26.779	00:04:30.540	 I didn't expect to see so many cars driving down the road
00:04:30.540	00:04:35.699	 I think it's a little bit out of the ordinary in English when we say something is out of the ordinary
00:04:35.699	00:04:42.979	 It's different than how it normally is. I would think that normally this town is very quiet on a Monday afternoon
00:04:42.979	00:04:46.139	 That there is very little traffic, but it seems to me
00:04:46.620	00:04:50.500	 Like there's almost a bit of a traffic jam if you look down the road
00:04:50.699	00:04:55.419	 There's this huge row of cars. I know the cars aren't flying by really quickly
00:04:55.419	00:04:58.539	 But I think this is definitely out of the ordinary
00:04:58.539	00:05:04.180	 I think normally on a Monday afternoon it would be very quiet and there would be very little traffic
00:05:04.540	00:05:09.060	 So behind me you can see our local hospital and I would say this
00:05:09.459	00:05:12.340	 Doctors and nurses work wacky hours
00:05:12.780	00:05:18.379	 When you use the word wacky in English you're describing something that is very abnormal
00:05:18.579	00:05:20.579	 Did I teach the word abnormal yet?
00:05:21.180	00:05:28.100	 Abnormal is the opposite of normal, but doctors and nurses work wacky hours. They work during the day
00:05:28.100	00:05:32.660	 They work at night. They work in the evening. They work early in the morning
00:05:33.060	00:05:41.700	 Most people have normal hours. Most people work from 8 to 5 or 7 to 4 or if you have a long day maybe 7 to 5
00:05:42.300	00:05:48.300	 But doctors and nurses definitely work wacky hours. By the way, we're getting a
00:05:48.700	00:05:55.940	 New hospital. They're slowly building a new hospital. The old one is in front here and the new one is
00:05:56.500	00:06:01.480	 just a bit to there about halfway done the new hospital. It's pretty cool
00:06:02.000	00:06:05.500	 Then the doctors and nurses could work wacky hours in that hospital
00:06:06.439	00:06:11.360	 Sometimes we just say something is strange if you look at this tree behind me
00:06:11.560	00:06:19.160	 You can see that it has all of its leaves on it still and that's a little bit strange for this time of year
00:06:19.840	00:06:26.000	 Normally at this point in the fall you don't see leaves on the trees usually
00:06:26.319	00:06:31.080	 They're all on the ground now. There's a lot of leaves on the ground. That's pretty normal
00:06:31.159	00:06:36.479	 But it certainly is strange that this tree still has all its leaves
00:06:37.359	00:06:43.240	 It's also a bit strange that the lake doesn't have a little bit of ice on it yet if we walk over here
00:06:43.560	00:06:47.360	 We're by Lake Ontario. It's a little bit strange
00:06:47.879	00:06:53.120	 Normally the lake isn't frozen over but normally at this time of year
00:06:53.399	00:06:57.479	 There's a little bit of ice along the shore just a tiny bit
00:06:57.720	00:07:04.160	 There's probably going to be people from this area who say there's never ice on the lake at this time in November
00:07:04.160	00:07:06.840	 But for me on November 25th
00:07:06.840	00:07:13.080	 I think it's strange that there's not a little bit of ice there and it's definitely strange that that tree
00:07:13.560	00:07:15.560	 Has all its leaves on it still
00:07:16.200	00:07:19.960	 Well, hey, thank you for watching this English lesson about
